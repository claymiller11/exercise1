We see by running the query that the correlation between the average procedure score and patient score is 0.3506015449448013.

This was calculated by taking the correlation between the average percentile a hospital fell in for all the measures detailed in the study (this was computed in the best hospitals step) and the overall score for a hospital. This latter score was computed as the sum of the hcahps base score and the hcahps consistency score. Indeed this is how they actual survey computes the score as well so I am fairly confident that it is a good metric of patient survey responses. The thinking was that if a hospital routinely gets in the top percentiles for procedures and they have a high overall score - or vice versa - there would be a strong correlation. Instead we see a correlation coeffficient of only 0.35 which signifies there is not a strong relationship between the average percentile a hospital is in for measures and its patient survery score. I could have also taken a percentile of the patient survey scores, but reasoned that this would have just resulted in the same value because there is only one parameter on which to do the percentile. Thus it would have just been a linear scaling and the correlation coefficient would not have changed. I also visually confirmed this by just looking at some of the values and with a cursory look the patient survey scores do not seem strongly correlated with average percentiles.
